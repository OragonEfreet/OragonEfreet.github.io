So here I am, starting a new project for a [full-featured game engine](/posts/banjo).
Well actually I started around a year ago, and while I am really enjoying it, I still haven't produced a single game with Banjo.

Why? Because we all know that [if you wanna make games, don't write engines](https://geometrian.com/projects/blog/write_games_not_engines.html).
