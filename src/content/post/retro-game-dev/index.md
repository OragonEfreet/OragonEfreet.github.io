This is the master page of what I will call the *Retro Game Dev* project.
I will update it with links to other related blog posts when they come out.

Retro Game Dev is a roadmap of about 50 games I will make.
For each year since 1972, I'll pick a landmark game from that yeat and build my own version.
I'll go year by year, going through video game history.

As of today, the list has a single game: [Pong](1972-pong).

This project is open source, and available from the [retro-game-dev GitHub repository](https://github.com/OragonEfreet/retro-game-dev).

This project drives [the developpement of my Banjo API](/posts/banjo).
Any new feature in the API must be developped in the context of an actual game to make.
This happens either because the current game needs the feature, or because finishing the game uncovers new ways to improve Banjo.
By moving chronologically, I can gradually ramp up complexity and tackle new challenges one game at a time.
