In 1972, the Digital Equipment Corporation released the DEC GT40, a vector graphics computer that feels like the kind of "oldish" cruncher you'd stumble across in games like Fallout or Alien: Isolation.

A year later, in 1973, Jack Burness was commissioned to create his own take on the "Lunar Lander" genre. The result was Moonlander.

While not the very first Lunar Lander game, Moonlander broke new ground in several ways. It was the first to be fully graphicalâ€”earlier versions had been purely text-based. It may also have been the first game to ever show a human character on screen: when players successfully landed, a tiny astronaut would appear on the lunar surface.
Finally, the game is known to probably be the very first game to have an easter egg.
It was possible to find a MacDonald's restaurant on the Moon, and even order a cheeseburger, or crash on it.

The game became a genre on its own, and after [nearly 60 years of Lunar Lander](https://technologizer.com/2009/07/19/lunar-lander/index.html), I made my own version:

import BanjoGame from "@/components/BanjoGame.jsx";

<BanjoGame client:load game="moonlander">
Press 'H' for commands.
</BanjoGame>

Compared to the previous game I made [Pong](/posts/1972-pong), this one is a huge bump and has a lots of "first" for this project.

## Drawing the Lander

We want a wireframe-style lander, to preserve the feeling of the old games.
And while we could do draw a sprite on the screen and scale/rotate it to having it our way, this does seem like an overkill solution for something as simple as drawing lines.

So, let's start from there, and assume the only thing we have for now is a "draw line" function, which could be used that way:

```c
void draw_line(x0, y0, x1, y1);
```

This simply traces a segment from _x0;y0_ to _x1;y1_ on the screen.
The implementation of such function is out of the scope of this post, but if you are interested, you can take a loot at [my primitives drawing functions](https://github.com/OragonEfreet/banjo/blob/main/src/bitmap_draw.c).

This function is enough to draw anything wireframey, given we feed it with the correct data.
So let's define a set of points in 2D space:

```c
const int lander_coords[][2] = {
    {-3, -7,},  {-7, -3,}, {-7, 3,},   {-3, 7,},
    {3, 7,},    {7, 3,},   {7, -3,},   {3, -7,},
    {-8, 8,},   {-8, 13,}, {8, 13,},   {8, 8,},
    {-3, 8,},   {3, 8,},   {-4, 13,},  {-7, 16,},
    {7, 16,},   {4, 13,},  {-10, 13,}, {-13, 17,},
    {-10, 17,}, {10, 12,}, {10, 17,},  {13, 17,},
};
```

Alone, these are just pixel positions, without shaping anything yet.
The pixel at index _0_ is _x = -3, y = -7_ and so on.

We now add a second array, that lists the lines that our lander is made of:


```c
const size_t lander_edges[][2] = {
    // Head
    {0, 1,}, {1, 2,}, {2, 3,}, {3, 4,}, {4, 5,}, {5, 6,}, {6, 7,}, {7, 0,}, 
    // Base
    {8, 9,},   {9, 10,}, {10, 11,},  {11, 8,},  
    // Neck
    {3, 12,},  {4, 13,},
    // Left leg
    {8, 19,}, {19, 20,},  {9, 20,}, {9, 19,},  
    // Right leg
    {11, 23,}, {22, 23,}, {10, 22, }, {10, 23,}, 
    // Thrusters
    {14, 15,}, {15, 16,}, {16, 17,},
};
```

Each pair in `lander_edges` describes a segment to draw, expressed in indices of `lander_coords`.
Thus, if we want for example to draw the 3rd line (index _2_ in `lander_edges`), we do:

```c
draw_line(
    lander_coords[lander_edges[2][0]][0], // Line 2, Coord 0, Axis 0 (X)
    lander_coords[lander_edges[2][0]][1], // Line 2, Coord 0, Axis 1 (Y)
    lander_coords[lander_edges[2][1]][0], // Line 2, Coord 0, Axis 0 (X)
    lander_coords[lander_edges[2][1]][1]  // Line 2, Coord 0, Axis 1 (Y)
);
```

Ok.
Combining this all in a loop through `lander_edges` is quite simple.
In the following code, I also shift all the coordinates by `x` and `y`, in order to center the drawing on the canvas:

```c
int x = CANVAS_W / 2;
int y = CANVAS_H / 2;

for (size_t e = 0; e < 25; ++e) {
    const float x0 = lander_coords[lander_edges[e][0]][0];
    const float y0 = lander_coords[lander_edges[e][0]][1];
    const float x1 = lander_coords[lander_edges[e][1]][0];
    const float y1 = lander_coords[lander_edges[e][1]][1];

    draw_line(x + x0, y + y0, x + x1, y + y1);
}
```

And here's our lander, displayed on a 50x40 pixel grid:
