Retro Game Dev is a roadmap of about 50 games I will make.
For each year since 1972, I'm picking a landmark game from that yeat and build my own version.
I'll go year by year, going through video game history.

For now, I'm just presenting the 1970's decade:

| Year | Game                                                                                |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1972 | ~Hunt the Wumpus~, ~Maze~, [**Pong**](/posts/1972-pong), ~Star Trek~, ~Spacewar!~   |
| 1973 | *Empire*, *Gotcha*, *Lunar Lander*, *Maze War*, *Space Race*                        |
| 1974 | *Gran Trak 10*, *Maze War*, *Qwak!*, *Speed Race*, *Tank*                           |
| 1975 | *Crash 'N Score*, *Gun Fight*, *Hi-way*, *Indy 800*, *Steeplechase*                 |
| 1976 | *Breakout*, *Death Race*, *Heavyweight Champ*, *Night Driver*, *Sea Wolf*           |
| 1977 | *Canyon Bomber*, *Combat*, *Street Racer*, *Surround*, *Video Olympics*             |
| 1978 | *Atari Football*, *Avalanche*, *Fire Truck*, *Sky Diver*, *Space Invaders*          |
| 1979 | *Asteroids*, *Galaxian*, *Head On*, *Lunar Lander*, *Monaco GP*                     |

For each year, I choose over a list of 5 games, hence the long list.
When a game is available for playing, I provide a link to it and all the 4 other games are striked-out.

This project is open source, and available from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OragonEfreet/retro-game-dev).
