    <p>Hello, my name is Kevin and I am not yet a game developer.</p>

    <p>
      This blog is used to present the <a href="/tags/games">games I am making</a> as well as the <a href="/tags/games">Banjo API</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This website was built with <a href="https://astro.build" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astro</a>, styled using the excellent <a href="https://github.com/chrismwilliams/astro-theme-cactus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astro Cactus theme</a> by Chris Williams.
      Its design was further tweaked with help from <a href="https://chat.openai.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChatGPT</a> by OpenAI because I don't know shit about CSS.
